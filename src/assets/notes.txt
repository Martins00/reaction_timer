THE LEARNING CONTINUES

//Randoms 
What is the disabled tag in html?IF you use it on a button, it'll not work o=with regard to the condition it has been given.
We use it by binding it in the component tag in the app.vue component.
Math.random should always start with a capital letter
Also, do not forget to add return each time you start writing the data component

//LifeCycle Hooks
They are majorly used to fire codes at different lifecycles of the component
We have the Mount,Updated and Unmount.
They do not need to be put in the methods component.  Just put it directly into the app.
